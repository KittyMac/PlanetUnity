#PlanetUnity

PlanetUnity is an XML-based user interface framework for Unity. Much like HTML, Silverlight, Android XML Layouts, PlanetUnity is a powerful tool for creating engaging, interactive experiences in the most powerful game development ecosystem on the planet.

**WARNING** PlanetUnity is in its infancy; if you want to dive in at this early stage, use with caution. Many aspects of PlanetUnity are changing quickly right now, and no proper documentation has been written.
